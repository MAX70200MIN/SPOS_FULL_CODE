Theory:


pass-1:
Define symbols and literals and remember them in symbol table and literal table respectively.
Keep track of location counter
Process pseudo-operations


Pass-2:
Generate object code by converting symbolic op-code into respective numeric op-code
Generate data for literals and look for values of symbols

programm working

START: This instruction starts the execution of program from location 200 and label with START provides name for the program.(JOHN is name for program)
MOVER: It moves the content of literal(=’3′) into register operand R1.
MOVEM: It moves the content of register into memory operand(X).
MOVER: It again moves the content of literal(=’2′) into register operand R2 and its label is specified as L1.
LTORG: It assigns address to literals(current LC value).
DS(Data Space): It assigns a data space of 1 to Symbol X.
END: It finishes the program execution.


pass 1 database:
source programm is used as input
for keeping track or each instruction location,location counter is used 
machine operation table is used to represent the symbolic mnemonic also action to be taken 
for each pseudo op code used in pass 2.
literals of the program is stored in literal tables with their assigned locations
lables and its coressponding value is stored in the symbol table.


conclusion:
thus, i have studies visual programming and implemented dynamic link library application for arthmetic operation.
