THEORY :

Priority Scheduling is a method of scheduling processes that is based on priority.
In this algorithm, the scheduler selects the tasks to work as per the priority.

The processes with higher priority should be carried out first, 
whereas jobs with equal priorities are carried out on a round-robin or FCFS basis.
 Priority depends upon memory requirements, time requirements, etc.



Algorithm/Flowchart: 

1-	First input the processes with their burst time andpriority. 
2-	Sort the processes, burst time and priority according to the priority. 
3-	Now simply apply FCFSalgorithm
