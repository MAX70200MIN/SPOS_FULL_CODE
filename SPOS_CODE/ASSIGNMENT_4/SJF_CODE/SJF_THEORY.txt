THEORY :

Till now, we were scheduling the processes according to their arrival time (in FCFS scheduling). 
However, SJF scheduling algorithm, schedules the processes according to their burst time.

In SJF scheduling, the process with the lowest burst time, 
among the list of available processes in the ready queue, is going to be scheduled next.

However, it is very difficult to predict the burst time needed for
 a process hence this algorithm is very difficult to implement in the system.



Algorithm/Flowchart: 

1. SJF 
 
1. Traverse until all process gets completelyexecuted. 
 
a) Find process with minimum remaining time at every single timelap. b) Reduce its time by1. 
c)	Check if its remaining time becomes0 
d)	Increment the counter of processcompletion. 
e)	Completion time of current process = current_time+1; 
e)	Calculate waiting time for each completed process. 
wt[i]= Completion time -arrival_time-burst_time 
f)	Increment time lap byone. 

2.	Find turnaround time(waiting_time+burst_time).
