THEORY :

First Come First Serve (FCFS) is an operating system scheduling algorithm that 
automatically executes queued requests and processes in order of their arrival.
 It is the easiest and simplest CPU scheduling algorithm.
 In this type of algorithm, processes which requests the CPU first get the CPU allocation first.
 This is managed with a FIFO queue. The full form of FCFS is First Come First Serve.

As the process enters the ready queue, 
its PCB (Process Control Block) is linked with the tail of the queue and, 
when the CPU becomes free, 
it should be assigned to the process at the beginning of the queue.

Algorithm/Flowchart: 
1. FCFS 
1.	Input the processes along with their burst time(bt). 
2.	Find waiting time (wt) for allprocesses. 
3.	As first process that comes need not to wait so waiting time for process 1 will be 0 i.e. wt[0] =0. 
4.	Find waiting time for all other processes i.e. for process i -> wt[i] = bt[i-1] + wt[i-1]. 
5.	Find turnaround time = waiting_time + burst_time for allprocesses. 
6.	Find average waiting time = total_waiting_time /no_of_processes. 
7.	Similarly,findaverageturnaroundtime=total_turn_around_time/no_of_processes.
