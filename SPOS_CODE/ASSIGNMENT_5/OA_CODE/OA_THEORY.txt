THEORY :
 
CONCEPT OF PAGE REPLACEMENT: 
1.	Page Fault: Absence of page when referenced in main memory during paging leads to a page fault. 
2.	Page Replacement: Replacement of already existing page from main memory by therequired new page is called as page replacement. 
And the techniques used for it are called as page replacementalgorithms. 

NEED OF PAGE REPLACEMENT: 
Page replacement is used primarily for the virtual memory management because in virtual 
memory paging system principal issue is replacement i.e. which page is to be removed so as to bring in the new page,
 thus the use of the page replacement algorithms. 
Demand paging is the technique used to increase system throughput.
 To implement demand paging page replacement is primaryrequirement.

PAGE REPLACEMENT POLICIES: 
1.	Determine which page to be removed from main memory. 
2.	Find a free frame. 
1)	If a frame is found use it 
2)	if no free frame found, use page replacement algorithm to select avictim frame. 
3)	Write the victim page to thedisk. 
3.	Read the desired page into the new free frame, change the page and frametables. 
4.	Restart the userprocess. 

2.	OPTIMAL PAGE REPLACEMENT ALGORITHM: Replace the page that will not be used  
for longest period of time as compared to the other pages in main memory.
Anoptimal 	page replacement algorithm has lowest page fault rate of all algorithm. 
It is called as OPT orMIN. 
ADVANTAGE: 
1)	This algorithm guarantees the lowest possible page-fault rate for a fixed no.of frames. 
DISADVANTAGE: 
1) The optimal page replacement algorithm is very difficult to implement, 
as it requires the knowledge of reference strings i.e. strings of memory references.
