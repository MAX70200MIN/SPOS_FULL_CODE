THEORY :
 
CONCEPT OF PAGE REPLACEMENT: 
1.	Page Fault: Absence of page when referenced in main memory during paging leads to a page fault. 
2.	Page Replacement: Replacement of already existing page from main memory by therequired new page is called as page replacement. 
And the techniques used for it are called as page replacementalgorithms. 

NEED OF PAGE REPLACEMENT: 
Page replacement is used primarily for the virtual memory management because in virtual 
memory paging system principal issue is replacement i.e. which page is to be removed so as to bring in the new page,
 thus the use of the page replacement algorithms. 
Demand paging is the technique used to increase system throughput.
 To implement demand paging page replacement is primaryrequirement.
If a system has better page replacement technique it improves demandpaging
 which in turn drastically yields system performance Agains. 

PAGE REPLACEMENT POLICIES: 
1.	Determine which page to be removed from main memory. 
2.	Find a free frame. 
1)	If a frame is found use it 
2)	if no free frame found, use page replacement algorithm to select avictim frame. 
3)	Write the victim page to thedisk. 
3.	Read the desired page into the new free frame, change the page and frametables. 
4.	Restart the userprocess. 

3.	LEAST RECENTLY USED (LRU): LRU algorithm uses the time of the pageâ€™s last usage.
 It uses the recent past as an approximation of the near future, then we can replace 
the page that has not been used for the longest period of the time i.e.
thepagehavinglarger idle time isreplaced. 

ADVANTAGE: 
1)	The LRU policy is often used for page replacement and is considered tobe good. 

DISADVANTAGES: 
1)	It is very difficult toimplement. 
2)	Requires substantial hardwareassistance. 
3)	The problematic determination of the order for the frames defined by thetime of lastusage
